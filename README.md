# Wing
Wing is a tool made to facilitate teaching math to a large number of people.
It leverages realtime visualizations of mathematical expressions to explain complex
relationships between variables, and tries to maintain cross-plataform compatibility
by relying only on web technologies for deployment.

## Architecture
Wing serves two distinct webpages through its server, one for the "admin",
and one for the "client". There can be multiple clients, but only one admin is to
control the Wing instance.
In practice, the admin is the teacher and the clients are the students.
